# StudyLatte
## Description
This iOS app was developed using Swift in XCode.
### The Function
The application allows users to find seating at local coffee shops to study. Users may view an intregrated map, displaying the 10 closest coffee shops to their current location; or the user may enter a different location and find shops in that area. Users are encouraged to interact with the app with discounts at local coffee shops; Users hit a button within the app once at the coffee shop, allowing others to know if seating is avaliable.
### The Reason
My team found ourselves commonly going to coffee shops to study...only to realize out that it was jam packed once we arrived. This was our solution.
### Third-party APIs
Facebook SDK (user account management). Apple's CoreLocation framework (location services). Apple MapKit (integrated map interface).
## How to Use
The app can be downloaded and imported into XCode, and run using an iPhone simulator. Main Swift code files are viewiable in the folder titled, "studylattefinal".
